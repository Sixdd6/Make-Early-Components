	<description>This mod allows you to create components out of Steel at a Smithy. The process is expensive early on but becomes much cheaper with the Component Assembly Table.

	Components can be made at these workbenches
	Fueled Smithy for 50 each
	Electric Smithy for 25 each
	Component Assembly Table for 5 each

	If used alongside my Organic Plasteel mod you can also make components out of Plastic!</description>
